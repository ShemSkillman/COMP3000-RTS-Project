# COMP3000 RTS Project
 Final year dissertation project made in Unity.

Project title: Exploring AI aggression and friendship in a free-for-all real time strategy game.

Vision: The aim of the product is to give the feeling of a multiplayer free-for-all RTS experience in a single player game. The AI will exhibit human-like behaviours to engage in management, combat, and diplomacy. What I want to focus on primarily however is the ability for the AI to dynamically make and break alliances with other players in a way that improves their chances of winning the game.
