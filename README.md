The product is aimed at teens and adults who have an interest in playing real time strategy (RTS) games such as StarCraft or Age of Empires.

The problem with many RTS games is the single player often becomes underwhelming once the player is too good at playing the game. A popular game mode in the RTS genre is free-for-all (FFA) where every player is pitted against each other. Each player starts with a base and has the goal of collecting resources, training an army, and taking out all the other players on the map. Some games such as Age of Empires 2 (AoE2) grant the ability for players to form alliances. Unfortunately, the AI in AoE2 will make no effort to form an alliance with other players, but instead will act on an individual basis even if it leads to defeat. Not only is this unrealistic, but it makes it much easier for the human player to take out each AI player one by one. Furthermore, the human player has the flexibility of forming alliances by donating a fixed amount of resources to an AI player of their choosing. This is problematic because there will be some cases where the AI would want to make an alliance even without receiving resources if it means they can survive or receive help to defeat a close enemy. This gives the AI a very rigid personality since they do not weigh the advantages of forming a friendship with another player. Likewise, the AI should be smart on when to end an alliance if it means removing a threat of their ally becoming too powerful.

Many people switch to playing online with other players where game modes such as FFA are much more realistic and fun to play. Unfortunately, the skill gap between human players can vary massively so there is rarely a balanced game where each player has equal chances of winning. What exacerbates this issue further is the active player base for an RTS game is relatively small making it harder to group players of similar skill levels into a game.

Another problem is many players have poor communication skills which makes it very difficult to play alongside them in order to achieve a common goal. This is partly due to the fact that everything is happening concurrently in real time so there is seldom any time to type something detailed into the game chat. 

The product, Cold Alliances, is a single player RTS game set in the medieval era that hopes to address all these problems.

The aim of the product is to give the feeling of a multiplayer RTS experience in a single player game. The AI will exhibit human-like behaviours using simple AI algorithms such as finite state machines and fuzzy logic to engage in management, combat, and diplomacy. What I want to focus on primarily however is the ability for the AI to dynamically make and break alliances with other players in a way that improves their chances of winning the game.

I want to mimic a fully human FFA experience which often involves a lot of politics and bargaining between players over the game chat. In Cold Alliances, all the players will start off at a neutral standing with one another. Later on, however, war can be declared against another player who may be expanding too fast or becoming too strong economically. The FFA game style will place an emphasis on the diplomacy side of the game because weaker players will feel compelled to form an alliance against a stronger player. Other possibilities could be considered, such as sending a tribute to another player to gain their favour in an act of peace or to form an alliance. This extra layer of diplomacy will increase the unpredictable nature of each game since even the strongest player is under threat from losing.

The communication between the human player and other AI will be quick and easy to use. This will be in the form of a UI interface that gives options to declare war, start alliances, or tribute resources with other players. Whilst the player is viewing the diplomacy window, the game will pause, so that all the AI will remain in a frozen state until the window is closed. This gives the player time to think of all their available options without having to rush opposed to how it is in multiplayer games.

Furthermore, Cold Alliances will give the human player a safe, controlled environment where the difficulty of the AI can be tweaked to what is desired. A smarter AI will make decisions based more on logic rather than emotion. For example, a smart AI will accept an offer of peace if their opponent is too strong. On the other hand, an unsmart AI would refuse peace out of anger even if it leads to their demise. Therefore, on an easy setting, the human player will have an easier time manipulating the AI and exploiting their lack of reasonable decision making.

In addition to this, since the AI is to behave like a human, each AI will be able to generate an opinion of the human player by remembering encounters and performance in previous games. For example, if the human player performs well in the first game, the AI players will recognise the human player as a bigger threat and are more likely gang up against the human player. Not only will this bring balance to the playing field, but it will give the human player a greater challenge in defending and attempting to make peace with the AI. Alternatively, the AI memory can be reset to neutral at the start of every game to remove this bias toward the human player.

Overall, the unique selling point of Cold Alliances is the ability to jump into games with other AI that makes the game feel like a multiplayer experience in the way they behave, react, and change over time.
