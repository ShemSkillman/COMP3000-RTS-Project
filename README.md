# Cold Alliances

Cold Alliances is a single player real-time strategy (RTS) game set in the medieval period where all players can attack one another in a frantic free-for-all game mode. Each player must gather resources, build a mighty empire, and manage their army effectively to remain the last one alive in order to claim victory.

The aim of the project is to explore different AI implementations within the RTS genre by researching existing computational models and algorithms. Although the focus is on AI, the secondary goal is to deliver a complete RTS game that can be played from start to finish.

## Features
 - Free-for-all game mode where all players are put against eachother. The aim is to eliminate all remnants of other players to win the game.
- Four military units to choose from: spearman, archer, horseman, and catapult, each with strengths and weaknesses.
- AI controlled factions that utilize behaviour trees to perform actions such as base expansion, attacking nearby factions, and forming random army compositions to keep gameplay interesting.
- Plenty of 'juicy' sound and visual effects e.g. buildings burning and exploding.
 - Single player lobby screen with plenty of customizable options: 2 maps to choose from, game speed, AI difficulty, spawn difficulty and more!
